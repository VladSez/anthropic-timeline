# Timeline: Anthropic, OpenAI, and U.S. Government / Defense Developments

Events and milestones highlighting interactions between Anthropic, OpenAI, and U.S. government and defense policy.

- **2026-02-28 02:56 (UTC): OpenAI agrees with Dept. of War to deploy models in classified network**  
  OpenAI strikes a deal with the Pentagon to supply AI for use within classified U.S. military networks. Sam Altman states that the partnership retains OpenAI's key red lines: "Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems."

- **2026-02-28 01:24 (UTC): Anthropic: Statement on the comments from Secretary of War Pete Hegseth**  
  Anthropic summarizes months of negotiations with the Department of War, ultimately breaking down over Anthropic’s refusal to allow mass domestic surveillance or use of their AI in fully autonomous weapons. They stress these exceptions haven’t impacted any government mission, argue current AI isn’t reliable enough for weapons use, and warn that domestic surveillance threatens fundamental rights. Anthropic calls the “supply chain risk” designation unprecedented for a U.S. company, vows not to alter their stance, and intends to challenge it in court. They assure customers that normal individual and business access remains unaffected—the new restrictions only apply to Department of War contracts.
