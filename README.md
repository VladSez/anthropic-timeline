# Timeline: Anthropic, OpenAI, and U.S. Government / Defense Developments

Events and milestones highlighting interactions between Anthropic, OpenAI, and U.S. government and defense policy.

- **2026-02-28 20:38 (UTC): OpenAI details Pentagon AI deployment agreement with enhanced safeguards**  
  OpenAI announced an agreement with the Pentagon for deploying advanced AI systems in classified environments, emphasizing that the deal has more stringent safeguards than previous agreements, including Anthropic's. The agreement enshrines three red lines: no use for mass domestic surveillance, no autonomous weapons direction, and no high-stakes automated decision making. OpenAI retains full control over its safety stack, deploys exclusively via cloud infrastructure, keeps cleared personnel in the loop, and maintains strong contractual and legal protections. OpenAI's approach aims to better protect against misuse, foster deeper democratic oversight, and prevent the erosion of AI safety guardrails. The company also requested that the same terms be offered to all AI labs and voiced opposition to Anthropic’s blacklisting as a supply chain risk. OpenAI clarified that their contract, contract language, and technical measures prevent both military use for domestic mass surveillance and the deployment of fully autonomous weapons.

- **2026-02-28 02:56 (UTC): OpenAI agrees with Dept. of War to deploy models in classified network**  
  OpenAI strikes deal with Pentagon to supply AI to classified military networks. Altman says the same red lines at the heart of Anthropic's dispute are enshrined in OpenAI's new partnership: "Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems."

- **2026-02-28 01:24 (UTC): Anthropic: Statement on the comments from Secretary of War Pete Hegseth**  
  Anthropic summarizes that after months of negotiations with the Department of War, talks broke down over two issues: their refusal to allow mass domestic surveillance or the use of their AI in fully autonomous weapons. They stress that these exceptions haven't impacted any government mission, and argue that current AI isn't reliable enough for weapons use and that domestic surveillance threatens fundamental rights. Anthropic calls the supply chain risk designation unprecedented for an American company, insists it will not alter their stance, and intends to challenge it in court. They assure customers that individual and commercial access will not be affected, and that the new restrictions would only apply to Department of War contracts.

- **2026-02-26 22:36 (UTC): Statement from Dario Amodei on our discussions with the Department of War**  
  Dario Amodei, Anthropic CEO, reiterates commitment to supporting U.S. national security and highlights the company's proactive deployment of AI models for military and intelligence use. Amodei explains that Anthropic refuses to support two specific use cases—mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons—on democratic and safety grounds. He details the pressure and threats from the Department of War to remove these safeguards, including blacklisting and 'supply chain risk' labeling, but affirms Anthropic will not compromise. Anthropic expresses willingness to cooperate with a smooth transition if offboarded, while maintaining hope to continue supporting U.S. defense with responsible safeguards in place.
