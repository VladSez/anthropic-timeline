# Timeline: Anthropic, OpenAI, and U.S. Government / Defense Developments

Events and milestones highlighting interactions between Anthropic, OpenAI, and U.S. government and defense policy.

- **2026-02-28 02:56 (UTC): OpenAI agrees with Dept. of War to deploy models in classified network**  
  OpenAI strikes deal with Pentagon to supply AI to classified military networks. Altman says the same red lines at the heart of Anthropic's dispute are enshrined in OpenAI's new partnership: "Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems."

- **Feb 27, 2026: Anthropic: Statement on the comments from Secretary of War Pete Hegseth**  
  Anthropic summarizes that after months of negotiations with the Department of War, talks broke down over two issues: their refusal to allow mass domestic surveillance or the use of their AI in fully autonomous weapons. They stress that these exceptions haven't impacted any government mission, and argue that current AI isn't reliable enough for weapons use and that domestic surveillance threatens fundamental rights. Anthropic calls the supply chain risk designation unprecedented for an American company, insists it will not alter their stance, and intends to challenge it in court. They assure customers that individual and commercial access will not be affected, and that the new restrictions would only apply to Department of War contracts.
